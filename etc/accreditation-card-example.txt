# A template has instructions how to print a competitor list.
# The list can be used for many purposes:
# - print weigh-in notes where the competitor's weight is written down
# - print ID cards
# - print diplomas after the tournament
#
# Template file is composed of lines. A line starting with a hash mark is a comment,
# otherwise it is a data line. Data belongs to one of the following categories:
# - general settings
# - attributes
# - texts and pictures
#
# General settings:
# - Card size is the size of the printed competitor ID/weigh-in note in mm.
#   As many as possible cards are fitted on one A4 page.
#     cardsize 105 59.4
#   Page geometry is a better way to tell how many cards you want on one page.
#   Printer marginals are taken into the considiration. 
#   The following line is the default and can be left out (2 columns, 5 rows).
#     pagegeom 2 5
# - Background picture can be used. Only PNG files are supported.
#   Picture is resized to the notesize. Example:
#     background C:\Pictures\MyBackground.png
# - Note is surrounded by a border. You can set the border line width.
#   Line width 0 means no border.
#     border 1
# - It is possible to print medal winners only. The following line prints
#   gold, silver, and bronze medalists:
#     winners 1 2 3
#   Positions 1-7 are valid. Note! You must print the results first, since that
#   saves the position information to the database!
#
# Attribute lines describe how the text should look like. Their values are valid
# until replaced by another attribute line:
# - Font should be something that is supported by your system. The deafult is Arial.
#     font Arial
# - Default font size is 12:
#     fontsize 12
# - Text can be bold and/or italic:
#     fontweight normal
#     fontweight bold
#     fontslant normal
#     fontslant italic
# - Font color is described by three numbers from 0.0 to 1.0. Numbers indicate the amount
#   of red, green and blue. The default is black. Examples:
#   White:
#     color 1.0 1.0 1.0
#   Black:
#     color 0 0 0
#   Blue:
#     color 0 0 1.0
#   Grey:
#     color 0.5 0.5 0.5
# 
# Text uses the current attribute values. A text line contains also text's 
# position (mm) and angle (degrees). Position is expressed by two numbers telling the
# text's distance from the note's left and top sides. The distance is measured to the left
# bottom corner of the first letter. Example text starting 15 mm from the left and 
# 30 mm from the top:
#     text 15.0 30.0 0.0 This is sample text
# Vertical text from bottom up:
#     text 55 77 90.0 This text is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
# Text going down in 45 degree angle:
#     text 10 20 -45 Going downhill...
# All the text after the angle is printed to the end of line.
#
# A picture can be inserted anywhere inside the note sheet. The picture line contains
# the position, size, angle, and path to a PNG file.
#     picture 10 20 10 6 0 C:\Pictures\MyFlag.png
# The position (10 20) is the place for the top left corner of the picture (mm). 
# Picture will be resized to 10x6 mm. Angle is 0. In the end of the line is 
# the file name of the picture.
#
# Both text and picture file name can contain special strings that are substituted
# by their real values. For example the following line would write competitors name:
#     text 10 20 0 Competitor: %LAST%, %FIRST%
# The note would have text "Competitor: Smith, John" and the next note could read
# "Competitor: Jones, Sarah", etc.
#
# The special strings are:
#
# %REGCATEGORY%       Name of the category the competitor registered.
# %REALCATEGORY%      Name of the category the competitor really participates.
# %LAST%              Last name.
# %FIRST%             First name.
# %CLUB%              Name of the club.
# %COUNTRY%           Name of the country.
# %CLUBCOUNTRY%       Club and country combined (result depends on the settings).
# %INDEX%             Internal database index.
# %BARCODE%           This is not text but a barcode presentation of the INDEX.
# %WEIGHT%            Competitor's weight.
# %YOB%               Competitor's year of birth.
# %GRADE%             Competitor's grade (belt).
# %ID%                Competitor's ID.
# %ID-BARCODE%        Competitor's ID printed as barcode 39. Supported characters are
#                     numbers, uppercase characters A-Z, and special characters 
#                     '-', '.', '$', '/', '+', '%', and space. 
# %ID-BARCODE-EXT%    Competitor's ID printed as extended barcode 39. All 
#                     the 7-bit ASCII characters are supported. Barcode reader must be set
#                     for the extended mode. UTF-8 is not supported.
# %WEIGHTTEXT%        Text "Weight" in selected language.
# %WINPOS%            Competitor's position in Arabic numerals (1-7). Note! You must print the results first!
# %WINPOSR%           Competitor's position in Roman numerals (I-VII).
# %WINCAT%            Name of the category where competitor won a medal.
#
# Picture file name can also contain the special strings. The following line inserts
# the flag of the competitor's country rotated 45 degrees:
#     picture 10 30 10 6 45 C:\Pictures\Flags\%COUNTRY%.png
# (The flags are not included in the JudoShiai software)
# 
# Next is the default template for the weigh-in notes (so there is
# no real use for it):
